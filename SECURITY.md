# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

The latest version released is the only version that will receive security updates, generally as a **PATCH** release unless a security issue requires a functionality change in which requires a minor/major version bump.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

For security reasons, the following are acceptable options for reporting all security issues.

1. Via Threema to [Vivo](https://threema.id/4AXFYVRP)
2. Open a ticket over the [MiData Support Center](https://itsupport.scout.ch/) to `Vivo`.
3. Via your PowerUser (you'll find him in your hitobito)

Please disclose responsibly and not via public GitHub Issues (which allows for exploiting issues in the wild before the patch is released).
If you want, you can create a new patch and then make a pull request. We will look into it and push it.
